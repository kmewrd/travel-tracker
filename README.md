# Travel Tracker



## How to Run
1. Clone the repo down to your machine
2. Clone the server repo [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)
3. Open the root directory for each repo and run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` in each repo to initialize the webpage and web server

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Webpack
- Mocha & Chai
- Atom

### Future Goals
- Add a logout button to the header
- Allow users to interact with the dashboard to view data for a specific day or period of time

### Design Inspiration
For the color palette, I turned to Dribble creator Dmitry Lauretsky's [Travel Agency Website](https://dribbble.com/shots/15163981-Travel-Agency-Website). I also drew inspiration from the Airbnb booking site in using rounded corners, small cards for past trips, an approachable sans-serif font, and minimal pops of color.

## Linting Your Code

Run the command in your terminal `npm run lint` to run the linter on your JavaScript code. There will be errors and warnings right from the start in this starter kit - the linter is still running successfully.

Your linter will look at the JavaScript files you have within the `src` directory and the `test` directory.

## Webpack?

If you look in the `package.json` file, you'll see one of the library dependencies called `webpack`. If you're interested in learning more about what Webpack is and how it works behind the scenes, take a look through the [Webpack configuration documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages. -->
